                high-level explanations and information on how to write your own document of Terms &
                Conditions. You should not rely on this article as legal advice or as
                recommendations regarding what you should actually do, because we cannot know in
                advance what are the specific terms you wish to establish between your business and
                your customers and visitors. We recommend that you seek legal advice to help you

            <h2>Terms & Conditions - The Basics</h2>
            <div>
                Having said that, Terms and Conditions (“T&C”) are a set of legally binding terms
                defined by you, as the owner of this website. The T&C set forth the legal boundaries
                governing the activities of the website visitors, or your customers, while they
                visit or engage with this website. The T&C are meant to establish the legal
                relationship between the site visitors and you as the website owner.
            </div>
            <div>
                T&C should be defined according to the specific needs and nature of each website.
                For example, a website offering products to customers in e-commerce transactions
                requires T&C that are different from the T&C of a website only providing information
                (like a blog, a landing page, and so on).
            </div>
            <div>
                T&C provide you as the website owner the ability to protect yourself from potential
                legal exposure, but this may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so make sure
                to receive local legal advice if you are trying to protect yourself from legal
                exposure.
            </div>

            <h2>What To Include In The T&C Document</h2>
            <div>
                Generally speaking, T&C often address these types of issues: Who is allowed to use
                the website; the possible payment methods; a declaration that the website owner may
                change his or her offering in the future; the types of warranties the website owner
                gives his or her customers; a reference to issues of intellectual property or
                copyrights, where relevant; the website owner’s right to suspend or cancel a
                member’s account; and much, much more.
