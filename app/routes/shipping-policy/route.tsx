            <h2>Shipping Policy - The Basics</h2>
            <div>
                Having said that, a Shipping Policy is a legally binding document that is meant to
                establish the legal relations between you and your customers. It is the legal
                framework for presenting your obligations to your customers, but also to address
                different possible scenarios that may occur, and what happens in each and every
                case.

                A Shipping Policy is a good practice and it helps both sides - you and your
                customers. Your customers may benefit from being informed about what they can expect
                from your service. You may benefit because people may be likely to shop with you if
                you have a clear Shipping Policy in place since there won’t be any questions about
                your shipping timeframes or processes.

            <h2>What To Include In The Shipping Policy</h2>
            <div>
                Generally speaking, a Shipping Policy often addresses these types of issues: the
                timeframe for processing orders; the shipping costs; different domestic and
                international shipping solutions; potential service interruptions; and much, much
                more.
